    SpamAssassin uses a unique point system to filter your e-mail.  Each
    message is analyzed and assigned a score based on a list of rules.  If the
    total score of the e-mail is equal to or greater than your
    <span class="bold">Required Hits</span> value, your message
    will be marked as spam.  Depending on your personal preference, you can set
    this number as high (lenient) or low (strict) as you like, though the
    default value of five is suitable for most people.
